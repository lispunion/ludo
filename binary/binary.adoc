== Abstract

This document defines a portable binary encoding for extended
S-expressions. It can encode every kind of object in the syntax of
every major Lisp dialect. Additionally, it can encode all of JSON,
YAML and XML.

Variable-length encoding is used for all number and length fields, so
there are no length limits. The native character encoding is UTF-8 but
other encodings are supported via encoding tags.
