= Lisp Union documents

This is a repository for written reports of cross-Lisp work:

* Lightweight standards
* Explorations
* Proposals
* Surveys
* etc.

Whenever it makes sense, documents in this repo should track
equivalent documents in the document repos of particular Lisp
dialects: Scheme SRFI, Common Lisp CDR, etc.
