== Abstract

This document introduces the `(declare-file ...)` form that can be put
near the beginning of a text file containing S-expressions. This form
is meant as a cross-Lisp standard to annotate a source file with
metadata.

Metadata is traditionally encoded as magic comments for which there
are countless ad hoc syntaxes. Since Lisp syntax is made out of a
naturally extensible notation, S-expressions, we can do better than
that and standardize an S-expression-based solution instead.

The solution is designed to fit easily into existing Common Lisp,
Scheme, Clojure, Emacs Lisp, NewLisp and Rep source files.

== Rationale

=== Prior art

==== Emacs

* `-*-` line
* local variables section
* package keywords
* lexical-binding comment

== Specification

=== Finding and parsing the declare-file form
